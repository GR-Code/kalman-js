# Description
This repo was the first attempt at hosting a Github Page for my JavaScript version of the Kalman Filter for mouse tracking.

`matrix.js` is a Matrix library written in scratch for this project. The Kalman Filter class is defined in `sketch.js`. I've used the p5.js library for interactions/graphics on the page.
